Asynchronous tasks -> 
Data fetch from some other source

fetch function : returns Promise 
(assurity to get the work done later)

Promise -> resolve / reject

Synchronous -> result available immeditely
Asynchronous -> result available later (doesn't wait and stop execution, go on next code)

async/await [preferred]


Another way ->
.then() -> data
.catch() -> error
.finally() -> no matter what
